  Antimicrobial resistance happens when microorganisms survive exposure to a
  medicine that would normally kill them such as antibiotics, antimalarials and
  antivirals. These microorganisms are often referred to as ‘superbugs’ and can
  leave medicines ineffective.


  The World Health Organisation has stated that ‘new resistance patterns are
  emerging and spreading globally, threatening our ability to treat common
  infectious diseases, resulting in prolonged illness, disability, and death.’


  The Fleming Fund is a UK Government aid programme to help low and middle
  income countries address priorities in tackling antimicrobial resistance
  (AMR), through a diverse range of projects. The Fleming Fund is led by the UK
  Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) and delivered through a number of
  key partners.


  The aim of the Fleming Fund is to support countries in collecting relevant
  high quality data that is shared nationally and globally. This will enable us
  collectively to better understand the scale and scope of the problem in order
  to effectively tackle the issue.
