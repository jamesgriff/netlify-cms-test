  Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a major public health threat in Vietnam,
  with a large population, high burden of infectious disease and relatively
  unrestricted access to antibiotics and is a key example of the difficulties
  faced by emerging economies in controlling AMR. The project in Vietnam is the
  first step in a substantial programme of support to countries bearing the
  heaviest burden of AMR infections. Lessons learned will be shared in regional
  meetings, engaging government and foreign development partners in Laos and
  Cambodia, and will help to shape the wider roll-out of the Fleming Fund in
  early 2018.
project_details: >-
  A Fleming Fund grant was awarded in 2015 to the National Hospital for Tropical
  Diseases (NHTD), the OUCRU, the University of Oxford, to establish a
  nationwide hospital-surveillance network and reference laboratory at the newly
  built site of the NHTD.


  The laboratory is housed within the new National Hospital for Tropical
  Diseases in Hanoi. Its remit will be to act as the reference laboratory for
  the accurate laboratory detection and surveillance of AMR in human bacterial
  pathogens across the whole of Vietnam.
