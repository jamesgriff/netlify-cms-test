  The Fleming Fund is a Â£265 million UK Government aid programme to help low and
  middle income countries address priorities in tackling antimicrobial
  resistance (AMR), through a diverse range of projects.


  The aim of the Fleming Fund is to support countries in collecting relevant
  high quality data that is shared nationally and globally. This will enable us
  collectively to better understand the scale and scope of the problem in order
  to effectively tackle the issue. 


  ## What will the Fleming Fund support?


  * Support the development of National Action Plans for AMR.

  * Develop and support the implementation of protocols and guidance for AMR
  surveillance and antimicrobial use.

  * Build laboratory capacity for diagnosis.

  * Collect drug resistance data.

  * Enable the sharing of drug resistance data locally, regionally, and
  internationally.

  * Collate and analyse data on the sale and use of antimicrobial medicines.

  * Advocate for the application of data to promote the rational use of
  antimicrobials.

  * Shape a sustainable system for AMR surveillance and data sharing.

  * Support fellowships to provide strong national leadership in addressing
  AMR. 


  ## Why focus on AMR surveillance?


  Countries need robust surveillance data on AMR and the use of antimicrobials
  in order to make informed decisions on their priorities and allocate (often
  scarce) resources to tackle AMR. Good quality surveillance data are therefore
  key to delivering effective national responses to AMR.


  International strategies on AMR have recommended improving surveillance as a
  key intervention to tackling the problem. These include the Lord O'Neil AMR
  Review comissioned by the UK government, the Global Action Plan on AMR
  published by the WHO and the Interagency Coordination Group Framework for
  Action on AMR. The Fleming Fund and its objectives represents an important
  part of the UK's contribution to fulfilling recommendations detailed in these
  plans.


  ## What does success look like and how will it be measured?


  By the end of the investment programme in 2021, the Fleming Fund will have
  helped 24 low and middle income countries to establish sustainable
  surveillance programmes for antimicrobial resistance and for monitoring of
  antimicrobial use in human and animal health. Outcomes will be an increase in
  relevant high quality data that are shared nationally and globally, and that
  form the basis for changes in policy and practice leading to better use of
  antimicrobial medicines.


  ## Where will the Fund operate?


  The regional focus of the programme is in Sub-Saharan Africa, South and South
  East Asia with Country Grants expected in 24 initial priority countries,
  identified through a detailed desk based review and key informant interviews.


  ## Who is delivering the Fleming Fund?


  The Fleming Fund is led by the UK Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC)
  and delivered through a number of key partners.


  ## When will the Fleming Fund be active at a country level?


  Many countries are already working with the Fleming Fund to pilot surveillance
  protocols, to report data on the use of antibiotics in animals, to develop AMR
  national action plans and a number of other key activities.
